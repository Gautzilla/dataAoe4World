  "description": "Trade Ships generate Gold when assigned to a trade route with a Coastal Trade Post or a Market near the shore. The distance between the trade target and Market determines the amount of Gold. Once assigned to trade, the Trade Ship will make repeated trips between its Home Dock and the trade target. You can assign a new Home Dock if you wish to.\n- No combat",
